    <title>Solving Multistep Inequalities</title>
    <p permid="XwA">
      When solving a linear inequality,
      we follow the same steps in <xref ref="list-solve-multistep-linear-equation">List</xref>.
      The only difference in our steps to solving is that when we multiply or divide by a negative number on both sides of an inequality,
      the direction of the inequality symbol must switch.
      We will look at some examples.

      <p permid="DDJ">
        Since the inequality solved in <xref ref="example-inequality-simple">Example</xref>
        has infinitely many solutions, it's difficult to check.
        We found that all values of <m>t</m> for which <m>t\leq-2</m> are solutions,
        so one approach is to check if <m>-2</m> is a solution and additionally if one other number less than <m>-2</m> is a solution.

      <sidebyside permid="Sym" widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
        <p permid="yTQ">
          Here, we'll check that <m>-2</m> satisfies this inequality:

          </md>
        </p>

        <p permid="faZ">
          Next, we can check another number smaller than <m>-2</m>,
          such as <m>-5</m>:

        Thus both <m>-2</m> and <m>-5</m> are solutions.
        It's important to note that this doesn't directly verify that <em>all</em>
        solutions to this inequality check.
        It's valuable though in that it would likely help us catch an error if we had made one.

          When a stopwatch started,
          the pressure inside a gas container was <m>4.2</m> atm
          (standard atmospheric pressure).
          As the container was heated,
          the pressure increased by <m>0.7</m> atm per minute.
          The maximum pressure the container can handle was <m>21.7</m> atm.
          Heating must be stopped once the pressure reaches <m>21.7</m> atm.
          In what time interval was the container safe?

      <solution permid="yjW">
        <p permid="hVF">
          The pressure increases by <m>0.7</m> atm per minute,
          so it increases by <m>0.7m</m> after <m>m</m> minutes.
          Counting in the original pressure of <m>4.2</m> atm,
          pressure in the container can be modeled by <m>0.7m+4.2</m>,
          where <m>m</m> is the number of minutes since the stop watch started.
        </p>

        <p permid="OcO">
          The container is safe when the pressure is <m>21.7</m> atm or lower.
          We can write and solve this inequality:
          <md permid="UBU">
            <mrow>0.7m+4.2\amp\leq21.7</mrow>
            <mrow>0.7m+4.2\subtractright{4.2}\amp\leq21.7\subtractright{4.2}</mrow>

            <mrow>\divideunder{0.7m}{0.7}\amp\leq\divideunder{17.5}{0.7}</mrow>
            <mrow>m\amp\leq25</mrow>

        <p permid="ujX">
          In summary, the container was safe as long as <m>m\leq25</m>.
          Assuming that <m>m</m> also must be greater than or equal to zero,
          this means <m>0\leq m\leq 25</m>.
          We can write this as the time interval as <m>[0,25]</m>.
          Thus the container was safe between 0 minutes and 25 minutes.
